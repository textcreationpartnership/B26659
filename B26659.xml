            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>Wee come now to Apply this Doctrine. There are two Uses to be insisted on, 1. By way of <hi>Instruction</hi> or <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> 2. By way of <hi>Exhortation▪</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. By way of <hi>Information,</hi> Inf. 1. <hi>We may see by this, that sin is the greatest folly in the world.</hi> Well might Solomon say as in the Text, <hi>neither be thou foolish,</hi> For to sin and doe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:199269:9"/> wickedly is the greatest foolishness that ever was or can be. Sin is a departure from the Rule of Wisdome. For a man to part with his life for nothing, is not that monstrous folly? And thus doth a wretched sinner doe. Mens sins are unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full works of darkness. What Profit had you of those things whereof ye are now ashamed? Sin is the most unprofitable thing in the world. It is good for nothing, neither for body, nor soul, nor name, nor estate, but brings death and ruin upon all. A man by sin (especially some sins) looseth his Name. A wound and dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>onour doth he get, and a reproach that that shall not be wiped away. And he loseth his life, and that <hi>before the Time</hi> as the Text sheweth; yea and without repentance will loose his soul for ever. Prov. 8. 36. <hi>Hee that sinneth against me wrongs his own soul.</hi> The Impenitent sinner brings ruin upon his own soul. Therefore sin is folly, and and the more sinfull the more foolish. The greatest Sinners are the greatest Fooles in all the world. Wherefore it is said Eccl 9. 3. <hi>The Heart of the sens of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

O what horrible madness is it, for any man, that so he may enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, to venture eternall damnation of his precious and immortall soul?</p>
            <p>Infor. 2. <hi>It followeth from hence, that shortness of dayes is in it self a judgment.</hi> For it is threatned as a Punishment of wickedness. It is a fruit of sin and of the curse. If Adam had not sinned there would have been no short lives, none of his Posterity should have had their lives shortned. And in the times of the Restitution of all things, when the Curse shall be removed, it will not be as at this day. Rev. 21. 4. <hi>There shall be no more death.</hi> To be sure there shall be no more such untimely death as our eyes doe with sadness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this day.

Therefore short life is in it self a judgment. Onely as to the elect of God, it is turned into a mercy. As afflictions are in themselves evill and fruits of the curse, but to beleivers they become the greatest blessings.

            <p>Infor. 3. <hi>Hence it likewise followeth that Righteousness <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>is the way to obtain long life▪</hi> If wickedness bring untimely death, then <hi>Righteousness will deliver from death.</hi> There is no r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But some one will say, do we not see that good men dye when they are young as well as others?</p>
            <p>Answ. Very true. As there are some that are <hi>too wicked to live long▪</hi> So there are others that are <hi>too Good to live long;</hi> in such an evill wretched world as this▪ Jeroboams godly son, dyed in his youth. Josiah a most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent servant of the Lord, dyed in the middest of his dayes. Enoch though the best man, and the best minister of God, in all the world in his time, was taken out of the world before he had lived half so long as men in those dayes were wont to live, but then it would not be good for them to live any longer. God is <hi>onely wise</hi> and faithfull, and therefoer he taketh his servants to himself, when he seeth that life will not be best for them.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:199269:10"/>
            <p>Besides, a man may live long in a little Time. It is said, <hi>the child shall dye an hundred years old.</hi> Isai. 65. 20.

Some live longer in seven years, then others doe in ten times seven years.

Moreover, that promise of long life will be fulfilled to the righteous in the life to come. As indeed all promises (and threatnings too) are fully accomplished in the world to come.

            <p>Use. 2. Let it be a word of <hi>Exhortation</hi> 1. Here is a generall word of exhortation. 2. More Particular.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us all be exhorted to make a right Improvement of such awfull Providences as the Text speaks of.</hi> There is such a Providence before us this day, which hath occasioned me to speak from these words at this Time.

            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:199269:11"/>
            <p>Answ. <hi>It should cause us humbly to reflect upon our own vile natures.</hi> Have we been kept from the like evills that others have been guilty of? No thanks to our own hearts, for wee have the same nature that they have, and if God had given us up to our own hearts lusts, wee should have been as bad as they, or as any of the children of men, that ever were in the world. Wherefore the Apostle in the third Chapter to the Romanes, discoursing of the state of men by nature, sait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

How should this thought humble us, and make us vile in our own eyes?

Look into the Commonwealth, and wee shall find that <hi>Magistrates</hi> are not honoured and acknowledged in their places as ought to be. Look into Churches, and how do some carry it there, as if that Scripture were <hi>Apocrypha</hi> even that Scripture Heb. 13. 17▪ where it is said <hi>obey them
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:199269:11"/> that have the rule over you, and submit your selves, for they watch for your souls.</hi> Look into Schools, and how doe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren contemn and dispise and disobey their masters contrary to the <hi>fifth Commandment?</hi> Look into Families, and O what disobedient Children? O what unruly servants may we find there? Nay, Look into the streets, and there we may observe (I have sometimes beheld it not altogether without greif and shame) the child behaving himself proudly against the Antient, and the base against the Honourable: so that in this respect <hi>New-England</hi> is in a great measure become de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate from the good manners of the <hi>Christian world.</hi> If there be any prevailing iniquity in <hi>New-England</hi> this is it. And therefore no marvell that such an awfull Providence doth come to rebuke and humble us, that servants have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired together to Kill their Master. There hath been no such deed done or seen in our Israel before now. And mark what I say, If ever <hi>New-England</hi> be destroyed, this very sin of disobedience to the <hi>fifth Commandment</hi> will be the ruine of this Land▪</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Use wee should make of this Providence, is <hi>to beware of those sins which do often times end in untimely death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pride</hi> is one of those sins. <hi>Corah</hi> was a Proud man, He could not bear to be subject to that order neither in Church nor Commonwealth, which God had appointed, and <hi>Hee dyed not the common death of all men.</hi> Haman was exceeding proud and highminded, and his pride brought him to the Gallows at last. But what need wee goe far for examples? One of these poor condemned Creatures that is here standing before the Lord this day, saith that he thinks his pride hath been his ruine. I asked him the other day in the prison, what sin it was that he thought in his Conscience God was provoked with him for, so as to leave him to that which hath brought him under this condemnation? He told me, he thought i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was for his Pride. <hi>For he thought much of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that such an one as He should be a servant, and he some times used such words as these, I am flesh and blood as well as my Master and therefore I know no reason why my Master should not obey me as well us I obey him.</hi> Thus did he say, and now we see what his Pride
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:199269:12"/> brought him unto, therefore beware of that sin.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Idleness</hi> is a sin that doth bring many to a miserable end at last. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was one of those▪ sins which caused thousands in Sodom and G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And <hi>Disobedience to Parents</hi> is a sin that is often punished with untimely death▪ (as was partly intimated before) One of these that are to be <hi>executed</hi> this day, doth confess that his disobedience to his Parents hath provoked the Lord, to bring this misery upon him. He saith that when he was a Child his Father gave him good Instructions and prayed for him, but he regarded it not. His Father would have had him gone to School, but he would not. His Father would have had him▪ gone to a Trade but he would not▪ And after his Father was dead, he would not be subject to those that had the care and charge of him, but ran away from them, and since that from time to time hath run away from them that have been his Masters. And now behold what all this disobedience hath brought him unto. All you <hi>disobedient Children</hi> that are here▪ before the Lord this day, hearken to the Word of the Lord. There is a Scripture which methinks should strike Terror and Trembling into your Souls, It is that Prov. 30. 17. <hi>The eye that mocketh his Father and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to obey▪ his Mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles eat it.</hi> The eye that mocketh his Father. Stubborness and contempt is to be seen in the eye, therefore the meaning is, that he that is stubborn and rebellious against his Father, shall be so dealt with. Well, a Father hath many times that Wisdome and Authority with him, that the child dare not disobey him, but he careth not for his Mother; Therefore it is added, <hi>He that despiseth to obey his Mother.</hi> You Children that disobey your Mothers hearken to this; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Yea God is so provoked▪ with such wicked children, as that he doth sometimes leave them against nature to destroy themselves as a just Punishment of unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall disobedience. There was an awfull example of this, which hapned in this Country about fifteen years agoe. I was not my self in this Land at that time, but I have had an account of it from those that knew it.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in, even your <hi>Master.</hi> O how have you risen up in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:199269:14"/> Rebellion against the glorious Image of God, not onely in that you have shed the blood of a man, who was made after the <hi>Image of God,</hi> but such a man as had peculiar <hi>Dominion</hi> over you, in that respect you have offered fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full violence to the sacred Image of the blessed God. So that you have transgrest the <hi>fifth and sixth Commandments</hi> at once in the highest degree that you could doe. And since your Apprehension, yea Conviction and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation you have told many lies (at least one of you, it is to be feared both of you) against your Conscience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Consider that <hi>now you must dye before your Time.</hi> especially one of you, a poor young creature that hath hardly lived twenty years in this world, and must this day be turned out of it. Yea, both of you <hi>dy before your Time.</hi> you might according to the ordinary course of nature have lived many a year. You must be cut off by a violent and dreadfull death. For indeed the anger of the Lord would fall upon this whole Country where your sin hath been committed, if you should be suffered to live.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Consider, <hi>That there is yet a possibility for you to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the second death.</hi> Though your sin be very great, yet God can pardon it.

There are some in Heaven that were once Bloody sinners. David was <hi>delivered from Blood guiltines<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> Upon his Repentance it was said to him, <hi>The Lord hath
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:199269:14"/> put away thy sin thou shalt not dye,</hi> As to <hi>the second death</hi> he did not dye. And Saul (afterwards Paul) had once the guilt of blood upon him, And therefore he made his Confession before the Lord, Saying, <hi>Lord; When the blood of thy Martyr Steven was shed, I also was standing by and Consenting to his death.</hi> Yea when he did repent and Turn to God in Jesus Christ, God for gave him his Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Know therefore, that there is Mercy enough with God to Pardon and Save as great sinners as you are.</p>
            <p>And know, that Jesus Christ the Son of God, Came to <hi>Save the chief of sinners.</hi> There is Merit and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness enough in Jesus Christ. Hee was bruised for our Iniquityes, and wounded for our Transgr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ssions. The wounds of Christ can make amends for those wounds which you gave your Master, when you slew him. The Blood of Christ can satisfie for the blood which you have shed. Jesus doth deliver from wrath to come. And he doth not exclude you from salvation by him, if you doe not by Impenitency &amp; Unbelief exclude your selves. Neither can the death you suffer hinder the Salvation of your souls, in case you truly repent and believe. Jesus Christ hath been made a Curse, that so he might redeem from the Curse of the Law. Yea Hee (the blessed son of God) was hanged upon a Tree, though Hee never knew any sin only for the sins of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and therefore he hath sanctified all maner of deaths unto those that shall beleive on Him. Oh Consider of it and let it break your Hearts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Consider <hi>Presently it will be too late for you to think of these things.</hi> when once you are dead, when once your souls are out of your bodyes, it will be too late for you to think of these matters. There is no Repenting in the Grave, there is no Believing in Hell. Behold <hi>now</hi> is your accepted Time, <hi>now</hi> is the hour of your Salvation. If you doe not <hi>Now</hi> accept of Jesus Christ upon his own Terms, you will be undone, and damned to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>By way of <hi>Direction</hi> I shall speak two or three words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Doe what you can that God may have glory by you that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Time that you have to live.</hi> Therefore see that you solemnly
